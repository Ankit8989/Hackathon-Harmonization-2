      "The Eiffel Tower is special for several reasons, beyond just being a famous photo spot:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Iconic design and history**  \n",
      "Built in 1889 for the World’s Fair, it was an engineering marvel of its time. Gustave Eiffel’s iron lattice design was controversial at first, but it eventually became the symbol of Paris and even of France itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Incredible views**  \n",
      "From the top (or even the second floor), you get sweeping views over Paris: the Seine winding through the city, landmarks like the Louvre, Sacré‑Cœur, and on clear days, far beyond the city limits. It’s especially beautiful at sunset.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Different experiences at different levels**  \n",
      "- The **esplanade** lets you appreciate its massive scale up close.  \n",
      "- The **second floor** offers the best balance of height and detail for views.  \n",
      "- The **summit** gives a true “wow” moment and a sense of being above the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Nighttime magic**  \n",
      "Every evening, the tower sparkles for five minutes at the top of each hour after dark. It’s a uniquely Parisian experience and very romantic.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Location and atmosphere**  \n",
      "It sits along the Seine near parks like the Champ de Mars and Trocadéro, making it easy to combine with a picnic, a riverside walk, or photos from multiple viewpoints.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even if you don’t go up, seeing the Eiffel Tower in different contexts—day, night, from across the river, or framed by Parisian streets—helps you understand why it’s so beloved.\n"
